#This is a task you have to do yourself.
#Task1: Say, You have a list of elements [1, 3, 4, 5], you need to write a program that gives the 
#product of all these elements i.e, 1*3*4*5=>60

#Task2: Say, you have a list of elements [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10], you need to write a program to print
#even elements in the list that are in even indexes ==> (0, 2, 10)
