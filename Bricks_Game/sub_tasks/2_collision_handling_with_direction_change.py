#This is an end to end task you should complete.
#Extend the event_handling.py(The previous assignment you have done, just modify that program.)

#Task1: Create a list named "targets" and store some Rect objects in the list.(You can hardcode the Rect objects position 
# anywhere you like.)

#Task2: Using the rect object you previously created(event_handling.py), Try to collide this rect object with any of the rect
# objects in the target list.

#Task3: Using collision detection, remove the rect object that is in the "targets" list. 
# HINT: use for loop to traverse through targets list and check if the rect object is collided with our movable rect object.
# If it is collided, remove it from the list.

#Task4: If the targets list is empty, exit from the main loop and quit from the program.
