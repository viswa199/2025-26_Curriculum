#This is an end to end project that you should complete.

#Task1: Create a pygame window, add title to it and make the window persist.

#Task2: Create a list named "moving_objects" and store a few rect objects in that list.
#(The position of the rect objects can be arbitrary.)

#Task3: make all the rect objects move randomly on the window screen.(Add boundary restriction for every rect object.)
