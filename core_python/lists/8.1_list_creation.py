# A list in Python is like a box that can hold many things together.
# You can keep numbers, words, or a mix of both inside a list.
# We can make a list by using square brackets [ ] and putting items inside, separated by commas.
# Loop through the list and print each item on line 11.

# Task 1 : Create a list of numbers from 23 to 28 on line 17.
# Task 2 : Write a for loop to print each item of the number list on line 19.

# Here, fruits is a list that contains three items: apple, banana, and cherry
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)

# Loop through the list and print each item
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
