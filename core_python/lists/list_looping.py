#Task: Create a list containing only integer elements. Using for loop, calculate the sum of all elements.

#we created a list named list1.
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#We are using a for loop to traverse the list.
#The for loop iterates over the elements of the list.
#The variable i stores the current element of the list.
#The variable i is printed in each iteration.
for i in list1:
    print(i)
